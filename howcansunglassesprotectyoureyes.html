        The sun can damage your eyes in numerous ways; cheap sunglasses that you purchased as a fashion statement may end up costing you more than you paid for those shades—they could cost you your eye health.

        As summer approaches and the sun stays in the sky longer, practitioners and experts warn that not all sunglasses can protect your eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) light. The biggest danger with poor sunglasses is if the glasses are tinted but do not block the UV rays. The tinting causes the pupils to dilate due to perceived darkness, allowing more ultraviolet radiation to enter the eye. Ongoing UV exposure can significantly harm your eyes.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Eye conditions such as cataracts, macular degeneration, ocular melanoma, and eyelid cancers may be linked to overexposure to UV radiation. Even sunburn of the eye (photokeratitis), similar to skin sunburn, is possible. The more your eyes are exposed to UV radiation without proper sunglasses, the greater your risk of developing one of these conditions. UV rays not only cause uncomfortable glare but can damage your eye health and the delicate skin around your eyes. It’s shown that <a href="https://www.columbiaeye.org/eye-library/eyelid-cancer" target="_blank" style="color: #007BFF; text-decoration: underline;">5 to 10 percent</a> of all skin cancer occurs in the eye area. Opting for sunglasses with polarization and UV protection is extremely important.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: #007BFF; margin-top: 30px;">What should sunglasses actually do?</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Look for sunglasses with a sticker or tag that promotes their UV-blocking capabilities. Your sunglasses should provide at least 99 to 100 percent protection against both UVA and UVB rays. Consider sunglasses with an anti-reflective treatment on the back of the lenses, as up to 50 percent of UV rays that reach the eyes come from reflection off the lens's back surface.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Choose frames that fit your face well and cover as much of the delicate skin around your eyes as possible. Wraparound-style glasses or surf-style glasses with larger temples block more sunlight than thin-framed glasses, offering side protection. When near water or other reflective surfaces, remember that UV rays come from above and reflect from below. Properly fitting sunglasses provide comprehensive protection from various angles.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        While sunglasses with features like polarization, polycarbonate lenses, and titanium frames may cost more, investing in your eye health is worth it. Many people wear their sunglasses daily, making quality an important consideration for long-term eye health.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Reputable brands often highlight the sun-protection factor of their sunglasses and offer additional protective benefits. They may also help you find the right fit for your face, ensuring optimal comfort and protection.
