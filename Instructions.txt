Task: Bulk Template Update

Objective: Align all templates with the styling and layout of Newtemplate.html while preserving their original content.

Instructions for Jules:

Reference Template:
Load Newtemplate.html as the master template for structure, CSS, and inline styles.

Template Update:
For each other template:

Replace its HTML structure and styling to match Newtemplate.html exactly.

Do not alter any text, images, links, or other contentâ€”only adjust structure and styling.

Consistency Checks:

Ensure table widths, padding, margins, and font styles are identical.

Preserve mobile responsiveness: stacking, alignment, and scaling must mirror Newtemplate.html.

Maintain email-safe HTML practices (inline styles, VML if present).

Output:

Generate updated versions of each template, fully aligned with the master template.

Confirm that visual rendering matches Newtemplate.html and all content remains intact.

Completion Signal:

Return a report listing all updated files with a confirmation that layout and styling are matched.
