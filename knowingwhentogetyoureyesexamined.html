    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">Eye health is critical to your overall well-being, yet it’s often overlooked until symptoms arise. Regular eye exams are essential, not just for updating prescriptions but also for detecting early signs of eye diseases and conditions.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">Eye examinations go beyond determining whether you need glasses or contact lenses. They’re crucial to preventive health care, identifying potential eye diseases and conditions that affect your vision and overall health. Conditions like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration can be detected early through exams, allowing for timely treatment.</p>
