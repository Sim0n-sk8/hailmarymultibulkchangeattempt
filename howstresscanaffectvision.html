        Chances are that you experience stress at some point in your day. However, chronic stress can have serious, long-term negative effects on your body—and your eyes are no exception.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Stress creates the ‘fight or flight’ reflex, helping us respond to perceived threats. While this reflex is natural and meant to protect us, modern stressors like work commitments or family life can overwhelm the body. During stressful moments, the pupils dilate to enhance vision. Prolonged stress, however, keeps the pupils dilated, potentially causing several problems.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: #007BFF; margin-top: 30px;">What can happen to your eyes when you are stressed?</h3>

    <ul style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Eye strain:</strong> Common from prolonged computer screen usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Blurred vision:</strong> Mild cases of blurred vision may occur.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry or watery eyes:</strong> An imbalance in tear production.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye twitching:</strong> Spasms in one or both eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Light sensitivity:</strong> Discomfort from bright lights.</li>
        <li><strong>Eye floaters:</strong> Tiny spots or shapes drifting across your vision.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Stress impacts individuals differently. While one person may experience all these symptoms, others may notice only a few. Regardless, stress causes tension in the muscles around the eyes, potentially leading to sensitivity and migraines.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: #007BFF; margin-top: 30px;">What to do when you are stressed to relieve these symptoms?</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        If you notice any of these symptoms, there are techniques to reduce stress levels and alleviate eye-related discomfort. Regular exercise and deep breathing exercises help relieve tension, relax the body, and calm the nervous system, which controls the fight-or-flight response.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #444444;">
        Taking proactive steps to manage stress not only benefits your overall well-being but also protects your eye health.
